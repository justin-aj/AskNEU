With a Group Fitness membership, you get access to all of our fitness classes. Each class is designed to accommodate participants of all levels. Our student instructors are here to guide and support you every step of the way. We look forward to seeing you in the studios soon!

Studio A and Studio B are available for use when they are not reserved for Group Fitness classes or clubs. Please note that entry is not permitted while classes are in session. You are welcome to use the available equipment, but these items should remain within their respective studios. Groups of 5 or more people who want to work out in a Studio together must reserve the space through ourfacility reservation request form.

Please reserve your class spot through Atleto.
