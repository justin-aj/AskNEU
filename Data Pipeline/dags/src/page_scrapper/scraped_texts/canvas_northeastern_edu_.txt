[What is Canvas?]

Canvas is Northeastern’s learning management system and digital home base for course content, assignments, and communication. Open, intuitive, and born in the cloud, Canvas streamlines all the digital tools and content that teachers and students love, for a simpler and more connected learning experience.

[Canvas Training and Support Resources]

Northeastern has made many options available for faculty to schedule training or support sessions.
Academic Technologies, The Center for Advancing Teaching and Learning Through Research (CATLR), and the Office of the Provost are all supporting faculty to learn more about this transformation by offering a variety of training and support options.
“After having worked with different LMS for the past 20+ years, Canvas has emerged as my top favorite – especially when teaching in different instructional formats such as hybrid and online.”
Carolin Fuchs
Teaching Professor, World Languages CenterCoordinator of Online Teaching and Learning, College of Social Sciences and Humanities
“[Canvas] is amazing and well suited to support the kind of digital work my students produce. It’s streamlined the workflow for both my classes and is saving me hours (not an exaggeration) each week. It’s wonderful to be able to use that time to serve students and pursue scholarship.”
